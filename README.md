This provides a redirect from carbon-lang.dev to
<https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/>, because we're not yet
intending to have content at carbon-lang.dev.

The index.html file exists so that https://carbon-lang.dev is a 200 response for
Azure and VS Code Marketplace verification, not a 404.
